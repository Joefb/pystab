Pystab is for P99 Everquest and will show what your backstab damage is.

Most of the time the text in your status box moves so fast you cant see that fat backstab
you just landed on the poor goblin. Pystab will show you your backstabs so you can feel warmy and fuzzy.

pystab requires python3 to run.
You must set the path to your log file on line 18. The log file is located in your Everquest folder
It will look something like: 
/home/homeDir/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Sony/EverQuest/Logs/eqlog_charName_project1999.txt"

You may need to resize the pystab window. You can also righ click the title bar and set to stay on top.
