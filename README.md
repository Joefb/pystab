# Pystab

## General Info
Pystab is for P99 Everquest and will show what your backstab damage is.

Most of the time the text in your status box moves so fast you cant see that 
fat backstab you just landed on the poor goblin. Pystab will show your 
backstabs so you can feel warm and fuzzy.

Pystab will search the EQ log file for backstab damage and display the damage.

You may need to resize the pystab window. You can also righ click the title bar 
and set to stay on top.
